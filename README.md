## About

This is a StackOverflow-clone originally developed in Flask as a Codecool team project. It has been rewritten entirely in Rails as an individual project.

## Installation

To run the application, first install its dependencies by running ```bundle install```.

Next, run the database migrations with ```rake db:migrate```, and seed the database with sample data by running ```rake db:seed```.

Finally, start the server in development mode with ```rails server -e development```.
